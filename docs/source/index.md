Receipt cataloging hub documentation
====================================

Receipt cataloging hub (`rechu`) is a Python module that implements a personal 
finance system which reads digitized receipts into a database model. This helps 
tracking detailed product purchases, cross-referencing items with product types 
and discounts, ultimately leading to reporting of price trends and recommended 
expense targets.
